Here I attempted to use Three.js with a coin model that i found online

To start the project, follow these steps:

## Getting Started

1. Install all project dependencies by running the following command:

   ```
   yarn
   ```

2. Start the app by running the following command:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

3. Go to localhost:3000 if you start it from your local network
